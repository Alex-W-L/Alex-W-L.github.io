								 	<h2>Interest in Data Analysis</h2>
										<p>My interest began relatively recently, in March of 2025. I spoke with a family member who manages
										data analysts on the topic and discovered that I already had some experience with a number of
										relevant tools. We talked about the field and I decided I wanted to learn more, so I did. I
										watched some video tutorials and followed along with guides to get some basics down, then I came
										up with a project idea. I wanted to do something local that was in an area that I felt was important.
										I happened upon PPB data from a data aggregation website and decided to run with my idea as a first
										project. I've worked for around 200 hours so far between learning more about Data Analytics libraries
										in Python, learning how to set up my own SQL server, learning how to use Tableau, and reviewing some
										Statistics from Khan Academy and Crash Course. I'm working on a Google Analytics certificate at the
										moment and trying to decide what my next project will explore.
										</p>
									<h2>Some Personal Information</h2>
										<p>I'm a relatively recent arrival in Portland, having moved here in 2023 from Sacramento, CA. I have
										some family who lives here and they offered to house up together, so now I am sharing a house with
										my sister and her partner. I went to college in Sacramento and wound up with 3 AS degrees, one in mathetmatics,
										one in electronics, and another for general science. I nearly wound up with one for physics as well, but I 
										didn't opt to take 2 forign language courses for that one. I wanted to work towards electrical engineering but
										life doesn't always play friendly with hopes. Lately, my hobbies have included forcing myself to go to the gym routinely,
										playing guitar (I recently performed at a wedding in front of a few dozen people), going on outtings with
										my family who live in the area, listening to audiobooks (mostly Fantasy, I'm a big Brandon Sanderson nerd) 
										and learning whatever piques my interest. 
										</p>
									<h2>My Musical Taste</h2>
										<p>Can't play music for years and not include a section about music for my about me page. Some of my favorite
											living guitarists are Marcin, Tim Henson (Polyphia), Buckethead, and Jack White (White Stripes). I'll give
											pretty much anything that's not rap or pop country a chance (even those sometimes too). My favorite concert
											of the last year was seeing Shakey Graves with Katie Pruitt as an opener. I'm always up to talk music and
											on the lookout for some casual musician friends to play with. 
										</p>
									<h2>My Media Taste</h2>
										<p>This is really just so I can nerd out on some books for a minute. It is probably reasonable to say that I am
											obsessed with Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere. If there is a topic I could talk for an hour on at a moments notice,
											this would be it. I love Robin Hobb's Realm of the Elderlings. She has some of the best character design and
											growth that I have ever come across. I've hated some of her characters more than Geoffrey in A Song of Ice and Fire
											(Game of Thrones series), then she has convinced me to love even characters that she made me hate first. My love of
											Fantasy started when I saw my favorite teacher in middle school, Mr. Slattery, reading a book with a really cool cover. 
											I asked him about it and was introduced to a series that now has a (pretty poor in my opinion) amazon TV show about it,
											The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan. I can still quote the introductory paragraph of those books by heart. 
										</p>
									<h2>My Contraversial Takes</h2>
										<li>I don't partake in most social media. I was pretty into it at a point in my life but I've tried to distance
											myself from it to retake some of my free time. You'll notice the social media links here are not necessarily
											what you'd expect them to be.</li>
										<li>The earth isn't flat or round, IT'S A DISC! And we travel through space on a great turtle with 4 elephants
											on it's back holding the disc up! (Please see love of Fantasy subsection and reference Terry Pratchett's Discworld).</li>
										<li>I'm not a pineapple on pizza person. Even if you remove the pineapple, the residue remains and I'm out. 
											Pineapple is the Pizza Killer. Pineapple is the little death that bring pizza obliteration (Did I mention
											my love for Fantasy, please reference Dune's Mind Killer quote).</li>
										<li>I think having some personal information on a resume can help separate you out from the crowd. You get to learn
											something about another human and it provides you some perspective on their personality.</li>
